## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I am a total newbie on GitHub and essentially at the moment I have joined to make access to other users I know, and who's work I am interested in, as easy as possible.

* I am currently trying to learn Python and Micropython as I am also playing with Raspberry Pi hardware in particular RPi Pico.

* If all goes well I may eventually have some code of my own to upload.

* I ought to also add that I am a rather old dog to be trying to learn new tricks!!
